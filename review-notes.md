### EX 00 - Setup
- Setup was easy. I didnt run into any issues. 
- I had node installed previously.
- There is an issue with a image under:
  - "Beginner Path: Use a Starter Repository" 
  - "Configure TypeScript"
  - "Install and Start a Local Server"
- Maybe put "Choose an Editor" and "installing Angular 2" under the same chapter to get the exercises and chapter names to match up

### EX 01 - Hello World
- 3. Hello World explained what is going on here well.
