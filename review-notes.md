### EX 00 - Setup
- Setup was easy. I didnt run into any issues. 
- I had node installed previously.

### EX 01 - Hello World
- Needed to ask for examples
- I dont know anything about ng2
- Confusion hits me when I'm told to "Write a `@Component` with a selector of `'app'`"
  - Luckily there will be examples provided to ease this pain.
- since im new, I need extra info on the new syntax such as @Component
  - [http://nosy-dirt.surge.sh/hello-world/index.html](Hello world explanation) helps this a lot
- to view what has been made: put contents of 01 in src
